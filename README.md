# Scream Tracker 3 Player

Here's a bit of a blast from the past. I used Scream Tracker 3 to learn to
composing in my teens. I had written a basic player back then. I've chosen
to rewrite a player as an exercise.

Please see the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_Tracker) for more information.

My goals are as follows:

 * Simplicity
 * Accuracy (Playback module as faithfully as possibly)
 * Portability (Windows, Mac, Linux, +)
 * Starting with C, but possibly moving to minimalist C++
